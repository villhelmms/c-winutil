This utility is a compilation of Windows tasks I perform on each Windows system I use. It is meant to streamline *installs*, debloat with *tweaks*, troubleshoot with *config*, and fix Windows *updates*. I am extremely picky about any contributions to keep this project clean and efficient.

## 💡 Usage

Winutil must be run in Admin mode because it performs system-wide tweaks. To achieve this, run PowerShell as an administrator. Here are a few ways to do it:

1. **Start menu Method:**
   - Right-click on the start menu.
   - Choose "Windows PowerShell (Admin)" (for Windows 10) or "Terminal (Admin)" (for Windows 11).

2. **Search and Launch Method:**
   - Press the Windows key.
   - Type "PowerShell" or "Terminal" (for Windows 11).
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + Enter` or Right-click and choose "Run as administrator" to launch it with administrator privileges.

## Issues

If you encounter any challenges or problems with the script, I kindly request that you submit them via the "Issues" tab on the GitHub repository. By filling out the provided template, you can provide specific details about the issue, allowing me to promptly address any bugs or consider feature requests.

## Contribute Code

If you adding, changing, or deleting an Application... submit to **APPLICATIONS branch**. We batch these in at the end of the month.

If doing a code change and you can submit a PR to main branch, but I am very selective about these. Do not use a code formatter, massive amounts of line changes, and make multiple feature changes. EACH FEATURE CHANGE SHOULD BE IT'S OWN Pull Request!

When creating pull requests, it is essential to thoroughly document all changes made. This includes documenting any additions made to the tweaks section and ensuring that corresponding undo measures are in place to remove the newly added tweaks if necessary. Failure to adhere to this format may result in denial of the pull request. Additionally, comprehensive documentation is required for all code changes. Any code lacking sufficient documentation may also be denied.

By following these guidelines, we can maintain a high standard of quality and ensure that the codebase remains organized and well-documented.

NOTE: When creating a function please include "WPF" or "WinUtil" in the name so that it can be loaded into the runspace.
